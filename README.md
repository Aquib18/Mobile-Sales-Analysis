📊 Mobile Sales Analysis – Power BI Project
I developed a comprehensive project in Power BI, Creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing , data cleaning, and data visualization


This project presents a complete sales analysis of mobile phone data from the year 2017, using Excel, Python (Matplotlib), and Power BI. The objective was to practice data analysis and dashboard creation with real-world data.

🔧 Tools Used
Excel – Data cleaning and preparation

Matplotlib – Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Power BI – Dashboard and visualization

📁 Project Workflow
Data Collection: Sourced the dataset from Kaggle

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, formatted data, and removed duplicates in Excel

EDA: Used Matplotlib to explore trends and understand key patterns in sales

Dashboard Development: Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:

Monthly Sales Trend

Sales by Company

Sales by Location

Quantity Sold by Product

📌 Key Insights
Identified peak sales months and top-performing brands

Compared regional sales performance across locations

Recognized the most in-demand mobile models

This project is ideal for demonstrating skills in data preparation, EDA, and dashboarding. The Power BI report can help stakeholders quickly grasp business performance and support data-driven decision-making.
